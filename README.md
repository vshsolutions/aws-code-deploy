This script deploys applications with the [AWS Code Deploy](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/welcome.html) service. The script uses the AWS CLI for underlying commands and extends functionality to provide common requirements for applications being deployed including compression, encryption, bucket revision limiting, monitoring, and more. It also handles creation of defined AWS Code Deploy components as necessary (e.g. Deployment Groups). By utilizing environment variables, this script is easily portable and intended to run inside CI containers. For more information, refer to the [AWS Code Deploy](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/welcome.html) documentation or the [AWS CLI API](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/deploy/index.html).

### Features:
 * One dependency: AWS CLI (Automatically installed if not available)
 * Automatically compress source directory
 * Ability to limit the number of stored revisions by a key prefix to help reduce S3 total file size
 * Server side encryption for revisions
 * Full diagnostic output from failed instances

## IAM Requirements

In order for the script to execute successfully, the specified AWS credentials must be granted the required 
IAM privileges for the corresponding actions. Since various steps of this script are optional it allows for
flexibility in creating policies that apply the principle of least privilege. Two common examples are described 
below. In general, the script needs access to the following (depending on parameters):

  1. Code Deploy - Verifying Application, Creating Application, Creating Revisions
  2. Code Deploy Deployment - Creating Deployment, Creating Deployment Group, Listing Instances
  3. S3 - Uploading bundle to S3, Deleting Old Revisions
  

#### Wildcard Access
This may be best for first time users with 


#### Explicit Access with Full Functionality

## Detailed Workflow & Variable Information

#### Step 1: Checking Dependencies

The following executables are installed:
  * python-pip
  * aws

#### Step 2: [Configuring AWS](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/configure/index.html)

This step ensures that configuration parameters for AWS CLI are properly set.

Environment Variables:

* `AWS_CODE_DEPLOY_KEY` (optional): AWS Access Key ID. If not already configured in **aws** cli, this is required.
* `AWS_CODE_DEPLOY_SECRET` (optional): AWS Secret Access Key. If not already configured in **aws** cli, this is required.
* `AWS_CODE_DEPLOY_REGION` (optional): Default region name

#### Step 3: [Checking Application](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/deploy/create-application.html)

This step ensures the application exists within Code Deploy. If it does not exist, it will attempt to create the application with the specified name.

Environment Variables:

* `AWS_CODE_DEPLOY_APPLICATION_NAME` (required): Name of the application to deploy

#### Step 4: [Deployment Config](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/deploy/create-deployment-config.html) (optional)

This step ensures the specified deployment configuration exists for the application. Defining a custom configuration is *optional* because you can use the deployment strategy already defined in Code Deploy.

Environment Variables:

* `AWS_CODE_DEPLOY_DEPLOYMENT_CONFIG_NAME` (optional): Deployment config name. By default: _CodeDeployDefault.OneAtATime_. Built-in options:
    * CodeDeployDefault.OneAtATime
    * CodeDeployDefault.AllAtOnce
    * CodeDeployDefault.HalfAtATime
* `AWS_CODE_DEPLOY_MINIMUM_HEALTHY_HOSTS` (optional): The minimum number of healthy instances during deployment. By default: _type=FLEET_PERCENT,value=75_

#### Step 5: [Deployment Group](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/deploy/create-deployment-group.html)

This step ensures the deployment group exists within the specified application. If it does not exist, the script will attempt to create the group using the name and defined service role ARN.

Environment Variables:

* `AWS_CODE_DEPLOY_DEPLOYMENT_GROUP_NAME` (required): Deployment group name
* `AWS_CODE_DEPLOY_SERVICE_ROLE_ARN` (optional): Service role arn giving permissions to use Code Deploy when creating a deployment group
* `AWS_CODE_DEPLOY_EC2_TAG_FILTERS` (optional): EC2 tags to filter on when creating a deployment group. Specify as a string with the following comma separated keys:
    * **Key** *string*
    * **Value** *string*
    * **Type** *string* - Either: `KEY_ONLY` or `VALUE_ONLY` or `KEY_AND_VALUE`
    
    For example: `AWS_CODE_DEPLOY_EC2_TAG_FILTERS="Key=Type,Value=www,Type=KEY_AND_VALUE"`

* `AWS_CODE_DEPLOY_AUTO_SCALING_GROUPS` (optional): Auto Scaling groups when creating a deployment group

Required IAM Access:
```
    "codedeploy:CreateDeploymentGroup",
    "codedeploy:GetDeploymentGroup"
```

#### Step 6: Compressing Source

This step compresses the specified source directory as a zip file in preparation for uploading to S3. This is useful for application deployments that use unique file names per revision. This helps limit the transfer to and from S3 during deployment.

Environment Variables:

* `AWS_CODE_DEPLOY_APP_SOURCE` (required): Specifies the root source contents of the application. The `appspec.yml` should exist within this directory. If not specified, the script will use the current working directory.
* `AWS_CODE_DEPLOY_S3_FILENAME` (required): The destination name within S3. Note that this should **not** include any prefix keys as these are defined elsewhere. A recommended good practice would be to use a combination of the CI build number with the git short revision. (e.g. "100#c3a5fea.zip")

#### Step 7: [Pushing to S3](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/deploy/push.html)

This step consists to push the application to S3.

Environment Variables:

* `AWS_CODE_DEPLOY_S3_BUCKET` (required): The name of the S3 bucket to deploy the revision
* `AWS_CODE_DEPLOY_S3_KEY_PREFIX` (optional): A prefix to use for the file key. It's highly recommended to structure a bucket with a prefix per deployment group. This allows to limit stored revisions per deployment group. Note: A leading or trailing slash is not required.

  For example:

  ```
  AWS_CODE_DEPLOY_S3_BUCKET="my-bucket-test"
  AWS_CODE_DEPLOY_S3_KEY_PREFIX="production-www"
  AWS_CODE_DEPLOY_S3_FILENAME="100#c3a5fea.zip"

  # The resulting stored file would exist at s3://my-bucket-test/production-www/100#c3a5fea.zip
  ```

#### Step 8: Limiting Deploy Revisions per Bucket/Key

This step ensures that applications with high revision/commit volume with unique filenames can remove
old revisions to help limit the size of the container. Large teams can quickly fill S3 with multiple
TBs/day depending on the projects. Since deployments typically don't need to store that many versions
backwards, this step will ensure that only N revisions exist, removing oldest revisions upon deploy.

> Note: If a limit is specified, the IAM permissions described below will need to be granted for the 
specific s3://bucket/(key).

Environment Variables:
* `AWS_CODE_DEPLOY_S3_LIMIT_BUCKET_FILES` (optional): Number of revisions to limit. If 0, unlimited. By default: 0

Required IAM Access:
* Wildcard: `s3:DeleteObject`, `s3:GetObject`
* Bucket Policy: `s3:ListBucket`, `s3:ListObjects`


#### Step 9: [Registering Revision](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/deploy/register-application-revision.html)

This step registers a code deploy revision for the uploaded file to the specified application/deployment group.

Environment Variables:

* `AWS_CODE_DEPLOY_REVISION_DESCRIPTION` (optional): A description that is stored within AWS Code Deploy that stores information about the specific revision. Typically, the revision details would store information specific to the commit/CI/build details.


#### Step 10: [Creating Deployment](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/deploy/create-deployment.html)

This step deploys the application revision using the defined deployment settings across all hosts that match the deployment group.

Environment Variables:

* `AWS_CODE_DEPLOY_DEPLOYMENT_DESCRIPTION` (optional): A description that is stored within AWS Code Deploy that stores information about the specific revision.

#### Monitor Deployment

This step monitors the deployment and logs information about the overall status as well as any failed instance statuses.

Environment Variables:

* `AWS_CODE_DEPLOY_DEPLOYMENT_OVERVIEW` (optional): Boolean that specifies whether to log detailed information about the status of the deployment. By Default: _true_
